# Kubernetes Ontologies With Meshery

Kubernetes has evolved into a complex ecosystem with numerous core components and hundreds of Custom Resources. This complexity poses significant challenges when designing
workloads that involve multiple technologies. Engineers often find themselves burdened with Complex Configuration Management with YAML files, ensuring correct network configurations, RBAC rules and so on which is tedious and error-prone.

Developers often need to manually copy and paste reference configurations or manage and store either Helm or Kustomize templates to achieve this which has a high learning curve and is
difficult especially for those new to the ecosystem.
This talk helps in understanding and leveraging Kubernetes ontologies with Meshery an open-source, cloud-native manager, and how it interprets these relationships through OPA policies, providing a robust and innovative method for infrastructure design.
